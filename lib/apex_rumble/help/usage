Apex Rumble is an apex library.
It is primary a model layer, and database interaction layer for your apex.
Rumble lets you query for, and act on SObjects, with apex classes you control.

## How Does It Work?

At the core is RumbleModels. These can be thought of as extensions of the SObject class.
Models have a property for each field that you care about, and can be quieried for without worrying about API names of objects or fields.
The rumble code never references API names in live code, which means you are more empowered to refactor your schema.

```
RumbleModel <-- Base object for Rumble Models!
├─ RumbleAccount <-- Generated from your schema. Don't touch!
│  └─ MAccount <-- Generated once only. Your model to play with!
├─ RumbleAsset
|  └─ MAsset
├─ RumbleContact
|  └─ MContact
└─ RumbleProject
|  └─ MProject
```

RumbleModels are designed to be used wherever you currently use SObject instances.
With this in mind, Rumble includes a RumbleDB class which implements the Database class with RumbleModels,
Rumble also includes the RumbleQuery class, which is a SOQL building object which plays nicely with your field subscription.

To learn more about a command, type `rumble help X`, for instance, `rumble help build`

To learn more about the Rumble API, read the code. There isn't a whole lot of it. The power is in the generated models!
